Web Scraper for TXST CS Staff (Theory of Automata Project)

This goal of this project was to use Regular Expressions to gather and display data on all professors on the Computer Science website, using PHP, Python, or a similar language. I chose to implement this project using PHP to process the HTML files.

Instructions for use 
------------------------------------------------------------
Download the desired CS faculty webpages as HTML files(available at http://www.cs.txstate.edu/Personnel/Faculty) and place them in the same directory as index.php. 

Navigate to the directory that now contains index.php and the facutly HTML files. 

Ensure that some sort of local host application is running (Xampp running Apache, for example) and is functional. 

Run index.php:
>php index.php 

Results will be written to appropriately named .txt files in the same directory. 

Keep in mind that if no string is found that matches a given regular expression in a  particular file, or there is no text within the matching regular expression, then that section will be blank in the corresponding output file. -----------------------------------------------------------
