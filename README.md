# Ryan Askew Code Portfolio - contains a small selection of programming assignments completed while pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Texas State University. 

# Each project has its own folder, which includes source code and a README file. Each project folder may also contain sample input / output files, an executable, a description of the original assignment, and other relevant files.

# For most of the assignments in that class, some of the code was given, and the rest was up to the students to fill out.
