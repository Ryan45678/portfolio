This folder contains a few assignments from my Assembly language class. They are written in MIPS, and each includes the asm file for the MARS emulator as well as an excel document containing the code (This was the professor's recommended way to save the code for printing).

For most of the assignments in this class, some of the code was given, and the rest was up to the students to fill out.
