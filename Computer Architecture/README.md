This folder contains the main programming assignment completed in my Computer Architecture class, which simulated a processor. These were written in C++, and the assignment was iterated and built on from assignment to assignment, so what is in this folder is the culmination of all the assignments in that class. Typically, most of the code for running the simulated processor was given, and we had to fill in the code to make it actually function the way it is supposed to.

(The provided simulator.exe will run the simulated processor)
