The LLN (Law of Large Numbers) project was a bonus project for my Probability and Statiscis class. I decided to create a simulated distribution of Amazon reviews based on the total number of reviews a product had received in comparison to its actual quality (empirical review probabilities). 

The results simulate the idea that a small number of reviews shows only the experiences that a select number of people had with a product, and is not enough to indicate a product's quality. The more reviews a product received in the simulation, the closer its overall review distribution came to its empirical distribution.

This program was written in C++, and requires the compiler to have support for C++ 11 enabled (-std=c++11).
